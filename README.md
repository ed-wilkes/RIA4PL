# RIACAL
Shiny app for RIA calibration curves

This app can be installed as an R package using the following command (requiring the `devtools` R package):

`devtools::install_github("nwlp-clinical-biochemistry/RIACAL", dependencies = TRUE)`

The app can then be run through the use of the `RIACAL::run_app()` function.

This app is also hosted at on shinyapps.io [here](https://ed-wilkes.shinyapps.io/riacal/).
